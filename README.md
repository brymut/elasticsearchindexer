1. Download ElasticSearch as a zip file from https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch and go through steps to install and run.
2. Clone this repo and move the avaloq_docs.txt to "c:/" or wherever you define in Program.cs ln 33.
3. Open the solution and Run. This adds the mock data to your instance of ElasticSearch. It should run fine with the Avaloq project afterwards.
